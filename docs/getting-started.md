## Create a new Spring Boot application

The DGS framework is now based on Spring Boot 3.0, so get started by creating a new Spring Boot 3.0 application if you don't have one already.
Note that you can still use the DGS framework with Spring Boot 2.7 by using a 5.5.x release.
The 6.x release of the framework requires Spring Boot 3.
The Spring Initializr is an easy way to do so.
You can use either Gradle or Maven with Java 17 or Kotlin.
We do recommend Gradle because we have a really cool [code generation plugin](../generating-code-from-schema) for it!

The only Spring dependency needed is Spring Web.

Open the project in an IDE (Intellij recommended).

## Requirements
The latest 6.x release and onwards will require Spring Boot 3.0 for your project. 
You will also need JDK 17.
If your application is on Spring Boot 2.7, you will need to use the 5.5.x release train of the DGS framework.
If your application is on Spring Boot 2.6, you will need to use 5.4.x or earlier.


## DGS Framework now using Spring GraphQL!
The DGS and Spring-GraphQL teams are super excited to introduce deep integration between the DGS framework and Spring-GraphQL.
This will bring the community together, and we can continue building the best possible GraphQL framework for Spring Boot in the future.
For the time being, we will offer 2 flavors of the DGS Framework - one with the vanilla version, and a version that integrates with spring-graphql via different starters.
There are no breaking changes to users as the changes are mostly internal to the framework and the spring-graphql integration should be a drop-in replacement for the existing framework.
For this reason, we encourage new and existing DGSs to use our spring-graphql starter as much as possible, as this will be the default offering in the future.
You can read more about the motivation behind integrating with spring-graphql and the details of the integration [here](spring-graphql-integration.md).


## Adding the DGS Framework dependency with Spring GraphQL 
Add the platform dependencies to your Gradle or Maven configuration.
The `com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-platform-dependencies` dependency is a [platform/BOM dependency](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/advanced/platform-bom/), which aligns the versions of the individual modules and transitive dependencies of the framework.
The `com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-spring-graphql-starter` is a Spring Boot starter that includes everything you need to get started building a DGS that uses Spring GraphQL.
In addition, you will need to explicitly add `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web` or `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webflux` depending on the stack you are using.

=== "Gradle"
```groovy
repositories {
mavenCentral()
}

    dependencyManagement {
        imports {
           mavenBom("com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-platform-dependencies:latest.release")
        }
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation "com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-spring-graphql-starter"
    }
```
=== "Gradle Kotlin"
```kotlin
repositories {
mavenCentral()
}

    dependencyManagement {
        imports {
           mavenBom("com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-platform-dependencies:latest.release")
        }
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation("com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-spring-graphql-starter")
    }
```

## Adding the DGS Framework Dependency
If you would like to still choose the non-spring graphql starter of DGS Framework, continue reading this section for details on the setup.

Add the platform dependencies to your Gradle or Maven configuration.
The `com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-platform-dependencies` dependency is a [platform/BOM dependency](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/advanced/platform-bom/), which aligns the versions of the individual modules and transitive dependencies of the framework.
The `com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-spring-boot-starter` is a Spring Boot starter that includes everything you need to get started building a DGS.
If you're building on top of `WebFlux`, use `com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-webflux-starter` instead.

=== "Gradle"
    ```groovy
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencyManagement {
        imports {
           mavenBom("com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-platform-dependencies:latest.release")
        }
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation "com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-spring-boot-starter"
    }
    ```
=== "Gradle Kotlin"
    ```kotlin
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencyManagement {
        imports {
           mavenBom("com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-platform-dependencies:latest.release")
        }
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation("com.netflix.graphql.dgs:graphql-dgs-spring-boot-starter")
    }
    ```

    ```

!!! important
    The DGS framework uses Kotlin 1.5.
    If you use [Spring Boot Gradle Plugin 2.3], you will have to be explicit on the Kotlin version that
    will be available. **This plugin will downgrade the transitive 1.5 Kotlin version to 1.3**.
    You can be explicit by setting it via Gradle's _extensions_ as follows:
    === "Gradle"
        ```groovy
        ext['kotlin.version'] = '1.4.31'
        ```
    === "Gradle Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        extra["kotlin.version"] = "1.4.31"
        ```

[Spring Boot Gradle Plugin 2.3]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.10.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html/

## Creating a Schema

The DGS framework is designed for schema first development.
The framework picks up any schema files in the `src/main/resources/schema` folder.
Create a schema file in: `src/main/resources/schema/schema.graphqls`.

```graphql
type Query {
    shows(titleFilter: String): [Show]
}

type Show {
    title: String
    releaseYear: Int
}
```

This schema allows querying for a list of shows, optionally filtering by title.

## Implement a Data Fetcher

Data fetchers are responsible for returning data for a query.
With the new Spring-GraphQL integration, it is technically possible to mix and match the DGS/Spring-GraphQL programming models. 
However, to maintain consistency in your codebase and to take full advantage of DGS features, we recommend sticking with the DGS programming model.

Create two new classes `example.ShowsDataFetcher` and `Show` and add the following code.

=== "Java"
    ```java
    @DgsComponent
    public class ShowsDatafetcher {

        private final List<Show> shows = List.of(
                new Show("Stranger Things", 2016),
                new Show("Ozark", 2017),
                new Show("The Crown", 2016),
                new Show("Dead to Me", 2019),
                new Show("Orange is the New Black", 2013)
        );

        @DgsQuery
        public List<Show> shows(@InputArgument String titleFilter) {
            if(titleFilter == null) {
                return shows;
            }

            return shows.stream().filter(s -> s.getTitle().contains(titleFilter)).collect(Collectors.toList());
        }
    }

    public class Show {
        private final String title;
        private final Integer releaseYear;

        public Show(String title, Integer releaseYear) {
            this.title = title;
            this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
        }

        public String getTitle() {
            return title;
        }

        public Integer getReleaseYear() {
            return releaseYear;
        }
    }
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ```kotlin
    @DgsComponent
    class ShowsDataFetcher {
        private val shows = listOf(
            Show("Stranger Things", 2016),
            Show("Ozark", 2017),
            Show("The Crown", 2016),
            Show("Dead to Me", 2019),
            Show("Orange is the New Black", 2013))

        @DgsQuery
        fun shows(@InputArgument titleFilter : String?): List<Show> {
            return if(titleFilter != null) {
                shows.filter { it.title.contains(titleFilter) }
            } else {
                shows
            }
        }

        data class Show(val title: String, val releaseYear: Int)
    }
    ```

That's all the code needed, the application is ready to be tested!

## Test the app with GraphiQL

Start the application and open a browser to http://localhost:8080/graphiql.
GraphiQL is a query editor that comes out of the box with the DGS framework.
Write the following query and tests the result.

```graphql
{
    shows {
        title
        releaseYear
    }
}
```

Note that unlike with REST, you have to specifically list which fields you want to get returned from your query.
This is where a lot of the power from GraphQL comes from, but a surprise to many developers new to GraphQL.

The GraphiQL editor is really just a UI that uses the `/graphql` endpoint of your service.
You could now connect a UI to your backend as well, for example using [React and the Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

## Install the Intellij plugin

If you are an Intellij user, there is a plugin available for DGS.
The plugin supports navigation between schema files and code and many hints and quick fixes.
You can install the plugin from the Jetbrains plugin repository [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17852-dgs).

![Plugin installation](./images/intellij-marketplace.png)

## Next steps

Now that you have a first GraphQL service running, we recommend improving this further by doing the following:

* [Use the DGS Platform BOM](advanced/platform-bom.md) to align DGS Framework dependencies.
* Learn more about [datafetchers](../datafetching)
* Use the [Gradle CodeGen plugin](../generating-code-from-schema) - this will generate the data types for you.
* Write [query tests](../query-execution-testing) in JUnit
* Look at [example projects](../examples)
